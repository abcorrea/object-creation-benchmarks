- Original domain had a "confidence" scheme: " Certain divers have no confidence
  in other divers and will refuse to work if someone they have no confidence in
  has already worked. Divers have hiring costs inversely proportional to how
  hard they are to work with." (from the IPC 2014 page)

  This has been removed -- together with the 'hiring-cost' function and the
  'precludes' predicate symbol. In this way, we can get rid of all ADL features.

- Since the only interesting action cost was the 'hiring-cost', we removed the
  rest.

- The goal now is just to have all photos. (Before the goal mentioned specific
  divers.)
