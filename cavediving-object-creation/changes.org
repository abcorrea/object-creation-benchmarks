- Name of the domain is now "cave-diving-object-creation"

- Original domain had a "confidence" scheme: " Certain divers have no confidence
  in other divers and will refuse to work if someone they have no confidence in
  has already worked. Divers have hiring costs inversely proportional to how
  hard they are to work with." (from the IPC 2014 page)

  This has been removed -- together with the 'hiring-cost' function and the
  'precludes' predicate symbol. In this way, we can get rid of all ADL features.

- Since the only interesting action cost was the 'hiring-cost', we removed the
  rest.

- We get rid of the 'available' predicate symbol and use object creation instead.

- All drivers start with a capacity of 4 (as explained in the IPC 2014 webpage)

- The numbers (from 0 to 4) are set as constants.

- We get rid of the 'next-tank' predicate symbol and replace it with object
  creation. Instances now only start with a single tank.

- The goal now is just to have all photos. (Before the goal mentioned specific
  divers.) The predicate 'decompressing' was also removed.
